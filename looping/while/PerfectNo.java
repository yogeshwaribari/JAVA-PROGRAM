Question 22: Write a java program to Check Number Is Perfect Number or Not.
Example : perfect number, a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors. 
The smallest perfect number is 6,which is the sum of 1, 2, and 3. Other perfect numbers are 28, 496, and 8,128.
Input:
Number = 6
Output:
Perfect Number
Explanation:
Proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3.
Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
Since the sum equals the number, it is a Perfect Number.

Input:
Number = 10
Output:
Not a Perfect Number
Explanation:
Proper divisors of 10 are 1, 2, and 5.
Sum = 8, which is not equal to 10.

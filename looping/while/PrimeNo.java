Question 21: Write a java program to check Number Is Prime Number or Not.
Example : A prime number is a number that can only be divided by itself and 1 without remainders.
The prime numbers from 1 to 100 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61,
67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.
Input:
Number = 7
Output:
Prime Number
Explanation:
7 is divisible only by 1 and 7.
Since it has exactly two factors, it is a prime number.

Input:
Number = 8
Output:
Not a Prime Number
Explanation:
8 is divisible by 1, 2, 4, and 8.
Since it has more than two factors, it is not a prime number.
